# Hows_The_Weather

The site tells the weather based off the entered city, by using the OpenWeatherMap API, and also changes the background of the page with a picture of the entered city, by using the Bing API.

animate.css was used to animate the fade in of the body and jQuery was used to create a loading page while the image loads from the Bing API.
